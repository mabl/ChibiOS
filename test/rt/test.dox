 * @page testsuite Testing Strategy
 * <h2>Description</h2>
 * Most of the ChibiOS/RT demos link a set of software modules (test suite) in
 * order to verify the proper working of the kernel, the port and the demo
 * itself.
 *
 * <h2>Kernel Test Suite</h2>
 * The kernel test suite is divided in modules or test sequences. Each Test
 * Module performs a series of tests on a specified kernel subsystem or
 * subsystems and can report a failure/success status and/or a performance
 * index as the test suite output.<br>
 * The test suite is usually activated in the demo applications by pressing a
 * button on the target board, see the readme file into the various demos
 * directories. The test suite output is usually sent through a serial port
 * and can be examined by using a terminal emulator program.
