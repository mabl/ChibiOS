/**
 * @defgroup STM8_COSMIC STM8
 * @details STM8 port for the Cosmic C compiler.
 *
 * @section STM8_COSMIC_INTRO Introduction
 * This port supports all STM8 8 bits MCUs.
 *
 * @section STM8_COSMIC_STATES Mapping of the System States in the STM8 port
 * The ChibiOS/RT logical @ref system_states are mapped as follow in the STM8
 * port:
 * - <b>Init</b>. This state is represented by the startup code and the
 *   initialization code before @p chSysInit() is executed. It has not a
 *   special hardware state associated.
 * - <b>Normal</b>. This is the state the system has after executing
 *   @p chSysInit(). Interrupts are enabled.
 * - <b>Suspended</b>. Interrupts are disabled.
 * - <b>Disabled</b>. Interrupts are disabled. This state is equivalent to the
 *   Suspended state because there are no fast interrupts in this architecture.
 * - <b>Sleep</b>. Implemented with "wait" instruction insertion in the idle
 *   loop.
 * - <b>S-Locked</b>. Interrupts are disabled.
 * - <b>I-Locked</b>. This state is equivalent to the SRI state, the
 *   @p chSysLockI() and @p chSysUnlockI() APIs do nothing (still use them in
 *   order to formally change state because this may change).
 * - <b>Serving Regular Interrupt</b>. Normal interrupt service code.
 * - <b>Serving Fast Interrupt</b>. Not present in this architecture.
 * - <b>Serving Non-Maskable Interrupt</b>. The STM8 ha non
 *   maskable interrupt sources that can be associated to this state.
 * - <b>Halted</b>. Implemented as an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.
 * .
 * @section STM8_COSMIC_NOTES The STM8 port notes
 * - The STM8 does not have a dedicated interrupt stack, make sure to reserve
 *     enough stack space for interrupts in each thread stack. This can be done
 *     by modifying the @p INT_REQUIRED_STACK macro into
 *     <b>./os/ports/cosmic/STM8/chcore.h</b>.
 * - The kernel currently supports only the small memory model so the
 *   kernel files should be loaded in the first 64K. Note that this is not
 *   a problem because upper addresses can be used by the user code, the
 *   kernel can context switch code running there.
 * - The configuration option @p CH_OPTIMIZE_SPEED is not currently supported
 *   because the missing support of the @p inline "C" keyword in the
 *   compiler.

/**
 * @defgroup STM8_COSMIC_CONF Configuration Options
 * @details STM8 Configuration Options. The STM8 port allows some
 * architecture-specific configurations settings that can be overridden
 * by redefining them in @p chconf.h. Usually there is no need to change
 * the default values.
 * - @p INT_REQUIRED_STACK, this value represent the amount of stack space
 *   used by the interrupt handlers.<br>
 *   The default for this value is @p 48, this space is allocated for each
 *   thread so be careful in order to not waste precious RAM space.
